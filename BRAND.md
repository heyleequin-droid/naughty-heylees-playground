# Brand guidelines — Naughty HeyLee Playground

This file documents the project brand (logo and colors). Please do not change these files without approval.

Files to preserve:
- `public/logo.svg` — primary logo (SVG)

Colors (CSS variables are provided in `src/styles/brand.css`):
- --brand-bg: #111 (dark background)
- --brand-gold: #ffd27a (primary gold)
- --brand-accent: #ff9a3c (gradient accent)
- --brand-muted: rgba(255,255,255,0.06) (muted divider)
- --brand-text: #ffffff (primary text)

Usage:
- Use the CSS variables for colors in stylesheets to keep consistent branding.
- The logo file should remain as-is to preserve branding. If you need a variant (color, size), add a new file with a different name and get it approved before replacing the primary `public/logo.svg`.

If you want to propose a change to the brand, open an issue and include design rationale and mockups. Any change should be reviewed and approved before merging.
